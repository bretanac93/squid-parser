* Program
The program maintains a dictionary of users associated to
downloaded data size in an one week period, which starts in
a supplied week day. There is a limit for each user,
determined by its group in the Active Directory, and when
its reached the program moves the user in the active
directory to the FinishedQuota group.

The day the period starts every user's downloaded data
size is reset to 0, and it is deleted from the group
FinishedQuota.
